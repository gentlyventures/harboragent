Harbor Agent is a product line from Gently Ventures.

Each Harbor Agent Pack is a focused, AI-native compliance and readiness co-pack for a specific government or industry initiative. We translate large, ambiguous initiatives into developer-ready artifacts and AI-native workflows that engineering, ML, and security teams can actually use.

The **Harbor Agent — Genesis Mission Readiness Pack** is Pack #1 in the Harbor Agent line.

It helps engineering, ML, and security teams prepare for credible collaboration under the U.S. Department of Energy's Genesis Mission by providing readiness checklists, governance and documentation templates, AI copilot playbooks (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, etc.), proposal and internal communication templates, and automation and audit scripts.

Welcome to the **Harbor Agent — Genesis Mission Readiness Pack**.  
This repository provides an AI-native, engineering-focused readiness framework for organizations preparing for potential collaboration under the U.S. Department of Energy's **Genesis Mission**.

This pack is **NOT** a regulatory document.  
It is **NOT** legal advice.  
It does **NOT** represent DOE requirements.  
It is **NOT** an official DOE or government document.

It is an engineering-focused readiness toolkit based on publicly available information.

Instead, it is a practical toolkit that helps engineering, ML, security, and product teams:

- Inventory systems and assets  

- Assess capabilities and gaps  

- Modernize data, models, and infra for reproducibility  

- Strengthen governance and documentation  

- Prepare credible, technically sound proposals  

- Use AI coding assistants safely and effectively  

- Generate repeatable alignment workflows  

This repo is structured so **AI copilots (Cursor, GitHub Copilot Chat, Claude Code)** can operate on it safely and meaningfully.

# 2. How to Use This Pack

## Step 1 — Read the Executive Summary  

Start with:

    /packs/genesis/docs/executive-summary.md

This gives you the context, purpose, and boundaries.

---

## Step 2 — Run the Gap Analysis  

Open the repo in Cursor or another AI-powered IDE and run the provided prompt inside:

    /packs/genesis/docs/gap-analysis.md

This creates a structured "current state" assessment.

---

## Step 3 — Use the Checklist  

Work through:

    /packs/genesis/docs/checklist.md

This is the definitive list of readiness items.

---

## Step 4 — Implement Changes Using Copilot Playbooks  

The heart of this repo is AI-native guidance:

    /packs/genesis/ide-playbook/

These files tell your AI assistant:

- What it may modify  

- What it must not touch  

- How to work in controlled batches  

- How to maintain reproducibility, security, and documentation integrity  

---

## Step 5 — Strengthen Security & Governance  

Review:

    /packs/genesis/docs/security-guidance.md

This helps ensure changes made by humans or AIs do not compromise security or governance practices.

---

## Step 6 — Build Your Partner Proposal  

Use the template here:

    /packs/genesis/docs/proposal-template.md

This creates the draft you can deliver to stakeholders, collaborators, or lab contacts.

---

# 3. How to Work Safely with AI Assistants

**Always provide the assistant with the following files before making changes:**

- checklist.md  

- gap-analysis.md  

- security-guidance.md  

- roadmap.md  

Then give one of the prompts from:

- qa-prompts.md  

- self-healing.md  

- copilot.md  

This prevents AI tools from hallucinating requirements or making unsafe changes.
