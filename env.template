# Note: For production, you'll need a backend API endpoint to create Stripe checkout sessions
# The frontend currently expects: POST /api/create-checkout-session
# This endpoint should:
# 1. Create a Stripe checkout session with the price ID
# 2. Set success_url to: ${origin}/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}
# 3. Set cancel_url to: ${origin}/#pricing
# 4. Return { sessionId: session.id }
