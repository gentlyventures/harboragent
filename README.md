Harbor Agent is a product line from Gently Ventures.

Each Harbor Agent Pack is a focused, AI-native compliance and readiness co-pack for a specific government or industry initiative. We translate large, ambiguous initiatives into developer-ready artifacts and AI-native workflows that engineering, ML, and security teams can actually use.

The **Harbor Agent — Genesis Mission Readiness Pack** is Pack #1 in the Harbor Agent line.

It helps engineering, ML, and security teams prepare for credible collaboration under the U.S. Department of Energy's Genesis Mission by providing readiness checklists, governance and documentation templates, AI copilot playbooks (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, etc.), proposal and internal communication templates, and automation and audit scripts.

This repository contains the **free, open-source portion** of the Harbor Agent — Genesis Mission Readiness Pack.

⚠️ This pack is **not** legal advice, **not** regulatory guidance, and **not** an official DOE or government document.  

It is an engineering-focused readiness toolkit based on publicly available information.
