## 12. What technical standards does Genesis align with?

The Genesis Mission aligns with several established frameworks:

- **NIST AI RMF** — The pack includes guidance aligned with NIST AI Risk Management Framework principles for validity, safety, security, and accountability
- **FAIR Data Principles** — Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable data standards are emphasized throughout the readiness checklist
- **Containerization standards** — Docker/Singularity compatibility for HPC environments
- **Workflow portability** — Alignment with Airflow, Nextflow, Prefect, and other scientific workflow engines

- [FAIR Principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)

---

## 13. How does this relate to other DOE initiatives?

Genesis builds on and integrates with existing DOE programs:

- **Exascale Computing Project (ECP)** — Genesis leverages exascale infrastructure and lessons learned
- **National Laboratory Network** — Genesis connects all 17 DOE National Labs through shared AI and data platforms
- **Energy Earthshots Initiative** — Genesis supports clean energy research goals through AI-accelerated discovery

The pack helps you align with these broader DOE strategic priorities.

---

## 14. What file formats and standards are required?

Genesis-aligned systems should support:

- **Data formats:** JSON, CSV, Parquet, HDF5 for interoperability
- **Model formats:** ONNX or equivalent portable formats for model sharing
