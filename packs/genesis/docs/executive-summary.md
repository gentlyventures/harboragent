# Harbor Agent — Genesis Readiness & Integration Pack  
## Executive Summary

The **Genesis Mission**, launched by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) in late 2025, is an
ambitious national effort to unify AI, advanced scientific computing, and cross-disciplinary
research under a single AI-augmented discovery ecosystem. The Mission will draw on DOE's 17
National Laboratories and its compute, quantum, materials science, and energy research
infrastructure.

While Genesis is **not a binding federal regulation**, it creates a powerful new alignment
point for:

- Energy-sector software vendors  

- Grid operations technology providers  

- Applied AI companies  

- Scientific computing partners  

- Federal contractors  

- Industrial R&D teams (materials, climate, fusion, power)

These organizations are already preparing internal readiness plans for potential participation,
collaboration, proposal cycles, and integration requests.

**This pack provides developers, engineering leads, and security/governance teams with a structured,
AI-native implementation kit for Genesis-aligned readiness.**

It includes:

- A technical overview of the Mission based on public DOE/White House materials  

- A detailed readiness checklist for engineering teams  

- A reference integration architecture  

- AI Copilot/Cursor/Claude Code instructions  

- A gap analysis worksheet  

- A 30/60/90 → 6 → 12-month readiness roadmap  

- A partner proposal template  

Harbor Agent's value is simple:

> We translate large, ambiguous government initiatives into developer-ready artifacts and AI-native
> workflows that your team can actually use.

This is *not* legal advice.  
This pack is an engineering resource designed to improve internal readiness, technical preparation,
and architectural planning with minimal overhead.
