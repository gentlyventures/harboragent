Harbor Agent is a product line from Gently Ventures.

Each Harbor Agent Pack is a focused, AI-native compliance and readiness co-pack for a specific government or industry initiative. We translate large, ambiguous initiatives into developer-ready artifacts and AI-native workflows that engineering, ML, and security teams can actually use.

The **Harbor Agent — AI Tax Assistant Readiness Pack** is Pack #2 in the Harbor Agent line.

It helps Individual Tax Preparers (ICPs), tax preparation practices, and software developers prepare for the 2025 U.S. tax filing season by providing readiness checklists, form processing guides, client communication templates, AI copilot playbooks (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, etc.), workflow automation scripts, and quality assurance procedures.

This repository contains the **free, open-source portion** of the Harbor Agent — AI Tax Assistant Readiness Pack.

⚠️ This pack is **not** legal advice, **not** regulatory guidance, and **not** an official IRS document.  

It is a preparer-focused readiness toolkit based on publicly available IRS publications, notices, and guidance.
