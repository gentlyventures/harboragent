# Harbor Agent — AI Tax Assistant Readiness Pack  
## Executive Summary

The **2025 U.S. Tax Year** brings significant changes, new forms, expanded e-filing requirements, and evolving regulations that impact Individual Tax Preparers (ICPs) and their clients. From inflation adjustments and new digital asset reporting (Form 1099-DA) to expanded Direct File programs and mandatory e-filing thresholds, tax professionals face a complex landscape requiring systematic preparation and modern tooling.

While these changes are **not a binding regulation** in the traditional sense, they create critical operational requirements for:

- Individual tax preparers (CPAs, enrolled agents, tax professionals)

- Tax preparation firms and practices

- Software vendors building tax preparation tools

- Accounting firms serving individual clients

- Tax professionals handling pass-through entities (K-1s, partnerships, S-corps)

These professionals must prepare for the 2025 filing season by understanding new forms, updated thresholds, digital asset reporting requirements, expanded e-filing mandates, and the integration of AI-assisted workflows into their practice.

**This pack provides tax preparers, practice managers, and software developers with a structured, AI-native implementation kit for 2025 tax year readiness.**

It includes:

- A technical overview of 2025 tax changes based on IRS publications and official guidance

- A detailed readiness checklist for tax preparation workflows

- A reference architecture for modern tax preparation systems

- AI Copilot/Cursor/Claude Code instructions for tax document processing

- A gap analysis worksheet for practice readiness

- A 30/60/90 → 6 → 12-month readiness roadmap

- A client communication and proposal template

Harbor Agent's value is simple:

> We translate complex, evolving tax regulations into preparer-ready checklists, AI-native workflows, and systematic preparation tools that your practice can actually use.

This is *not* legal advice.  
This pack is a practical resource designed to improve internal readiness, technical preparation, and workflow modernization with minimal overhead.
